=========================================

Simple PDF reporting rails plugin built on top of ruport.

Requires Ruport
gem install ruport

This plugin provides a simple method of generating pdfs. Please refer to 
the API Documentation in rdoc/ to see the methods available.

This is designed to render pdfs with a layout comprising of a header, body and a footer.

If you need to perform more complicated pdf rendering operation 
please refer to the API Documentation for pdf-writer. The API docs for 
ruport will also be useful if you are involved in presenting tabular 
data from activerecord.

You can access the pdf_writer object through your class. You should 
extend a class from the Rupdf:Base class and call the define_variables, 
define_header, define_body and define_footer classes.

Example programming code along with how to call it is supplied in the 
examples directory. Have a look at test_controller for how to call it 
from within the application flow.

For more information please refer to the tutorial online at:

Please not that at the moment this is compatible with Ruport 1.2.3 and not the newest version.
gem install ruport -v1.2.3
