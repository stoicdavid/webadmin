TimePicker
==========

The usage of time_picker follows closely of that of ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper.

Once installed, use it in your views.

Right now, the only method is 

time_picker(datetime, options = {})

Examples
--------
To use a time_picker with the default 24 hour format, 30 minute step, 

time_picker(Time.now, {:minute_step => 30})

To use a time_picker with 12 hour format, 30 minute step,

time_picker(Time.now, {:time_format => '12', :minute_step => 30})

Other options (same as ActionView::Helpers::DateHelper) are:

* :prefix
* :field_name
* :time_separator
