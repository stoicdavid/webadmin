Prawn is a PDF writing library for Ruby designed to be tiny, fast, and nimble,
just like the majestic sea creature.

Development on this library is made possible thanks to the many people who
donated to the Ruby Mendicant project:

NOTES TO DEVELOPERS: 

You will need the pdf-reader and test-spec gems to run Prawn.  Be sure to run
the specs on both Ruby 1.8.6 and the latest Ruby 1.9 snapshot, as both versions
are supported.  1.8.7 is *not* officially supported.

Prawn relies on PDF::Inspector, a collection of PDF::Reader backed classes
for analyzing PDF output.  This is provided as a submodule in Prawn's git
repository, so be sure to do the following before running the specs:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update
